# Job-Market-Analysis
This project analyzes job market data to predict salaries using machine learning. After cleaning and parsing salary info, we applied feature engineering on job types, employment, and locations. EDA revealed key correlations, and models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost) were trained, with ensembles delivering the best performance.

Job Market Data Analysis (LinkedIn / Glassdoor)

1.Topic Overview :- The project focuses on analyzing job postings data (from LinkedIn, Glassdoor, or Kaggle datasets) to uncover patterns and trends in the labor market. The analysis will revolve around skills demand, salary distributions, and remote work trends, followed by predictive modeling for salary estimation.

2 Dataset :-

LinkedIn / Glassdoor scrapers (requires API or scraping).
Kaggle datasets (many exist for tech jobs, salaries, skills).
3 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Most In-demand Skills:- 1. Extract and count frequency of skills in postings, 2.Word clouds / bar plots of top 20 skills, 3.Skill trends over time
Salary Distribution:- 1.Salary per job role (Data Scientist, Software Engineer, Product Manager), 2.Salary per region (US vs. Europe vs. Asia), 3.Salary comparison by industry (tech, healthcare, finance),
ðŸ¤– 4. Machine Learning Component :- The ML task can be Salary Prediction based on features like: Job title, Location, Skills, Industry, experience level (if available) Approches:-

Regression models:- Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boositing, Predict salary given job features.
Classification (Salary Band Prediction):- Convert salaries into bins (e.g., Low, Medium, High), Train a classifier (Logistic Regression, XGBoost, Neural Net).
Feature Engineering Ideas:

Encode skills as binary features
Convert job title into embeddings / clusters.
Location â†’ region-level dummy variables.
Normalize salaries (USD conversion if dataset is international).
ðŸ“ˆ 5. Visualizations:-Bar plots: Top 20 skills, Boxplots / violin plots: Salary by job role / region, Heatmaps: Skill co-occurrence (e.g., Python), Line charts: Remote job trends over time, Geospatial maps: Average salaries by city/country.

ðŸ’¡ 6. Why this Topic is Valuable :-

For Job Seekers â†’ Identifies in-demand skills and expected salaries.
For Employers â†’ Competitive salary benchmarking.
For Policy Makers â†’ Remote work adoption trends.
For Researchers â†’ Dataset for NLP + ML applications.
ðŸ›  7. Tools & Tech Stack:-

Python Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly.
NLP & Skills Extraction: NLTK, SpaCy, Scikit-learn (TF-IDF).
ML Models: Scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM.
