# Job-Market-Analysis
This project analyzes job market data to predict salaries using machine learning. After cleaning and parsing salary info, we applied feature engineering on job types, employment, and locations. EDA revealed key correlations, and models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost) were trained, with ensembles delivering the best performance.
